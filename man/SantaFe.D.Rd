\description{
Univariate time series D from the Santa Fe Time Series Competition.
Data Type: Simulated nonlinear time series. Category: Benchmark. Observations: 100,500.
This benchmark dataset is composed of a four-dimensional nonlinear and non-stationary series.
Competitors were asked to predict the last 500 observations, and performance was evaluated using NMSE.

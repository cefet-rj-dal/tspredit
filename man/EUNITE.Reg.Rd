\title{EUNITE Competition – Regressors for Load Forecasting}
\format{
A data frame with 730 rows and 3 columns:
\describe{
\item{Holiday}{Binary indicator (1 = holiday, 0 = regular day).}
\item{Weekday}{Integer encoding (1 = Sunday, ..., 7 = Saturday).}
\item{split}{Split into train and test}
}
}
\source{
EUNITE Competition 2001 dataset (original competition website currently unavailable).
}
\usage{
data(EUNITE.Reg)
}
\description{
Daily holiday and weekday indicators used as regressors in the EUNITE load forecasting competition.
Data Type: Categorical indicators. Category: Benchmark. Observations: 730 (1997–1998).
This dataset provides binary holiday flags and weekday identifiers to support the prediction of daily maximum electrical loads.
It complements the datasets \code{\link{EUNITE.Loads}} and \code{\link{EUNITE.Temp}}.
A test set with corresponding regressors for January 1999 is available.
}
\details{
Regressors complement the load profiles by providing daily-level covariates (e.g., holidays and weekdays),
which are known to improve forecast accuracy when used with temperature.

\examples{
# Load EUNITE regressors

# EUNITE.Reg <- loadfulldata(EUNITE.Reg)

# Peek at the first rows

# Filtering Examples

This folder contains examples for denoising, smoothing, and decomposing time series using a variety of filters.

- [ts_fil_ema.md](ts_fil_ema.md) — Exponential moving average smoothing to emphasize recent observations.
- [ts_fil_emd.md](ts_fil_emd.md) — Empirical Mode Decomposition for adaptive, data-driven denoising.
- [ts_fil_fft.md](ts_fil_fft.md) — Frequency-domain filtering using Fourier transforms to remove selected frequencies.
- [ts_fil_hp.md](ts_fil_hp.md) — Hodrick–Prescott filter to separate trend and cyclical components.
- [ts_fil_kalman.md](ts_fil_kalman.md) — Kalman filter smoothing for state-space modeled signals.
- [ts_fil_lowess.md](ts_fil_lowess.md) — Locally weighted regression (LOWESS/LOESS) smoothing for flexible trend extraction.
- [ts_fil_ma.md](ts_fil_ma.md) — Simple moving average smoothing over a fixed window.
- [ts_fil_none.md](ts_fil_none.md) — Baseline with no filtering; useful for comparison.
- [ts_fil_qes.md](ts_fil_qes.md) — Exponential-style smoothing/quantile-emphasis variant (QES) for robust smoothing.
- [ts_fil_remd.md](ts_fil_remd.md) — Robust EMD variant to mitigate noise and outliers.
- [ts_fil_seas_adj.md](ts_fil_seas_adj.md) — Seasonal adjustment using decomposition to remove seasonal patterns.
- [ts_fil_smooth.md](ts_fil_smooth.md) — Generic smoothing routine for noise reduction.
- [ts_fil_spline.md](ts_fil_spline.md) — Smoothing splines controlling curvature via a smoothing parameter.
- [ts_fil_wavelet.md](ts_fil_wavelet.md) — Wavelet denoising to capture features across multiple scales.
- [ts_fil_winsor.md](ts_fil_winsor.md) — Winsorization to limit the influence of extreme outliers.
